    Q.  Why this file is almost empty?

    Ans- I have included all the preprocessing code along with the data they 
    are supposed to work on.
    Creating separate classes for them and keeping them in separate file
    would lead to unnecessary imports.

    For example check SegmentationModel.predict() line 60-70 in 
    models/segmentation_model.py.
